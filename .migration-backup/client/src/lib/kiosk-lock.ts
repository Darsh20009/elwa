/**
 * Kiosk Lock — keeps the POS/kiosk screen from being knocked out of place by
 * OS-level gestures.
 *
 * IMPORTANT CONTEXT: the "screen shrinks into a corner for a few seconds then
 * comes back" symptom (sometimes paired with a flash of white) that recurs on
 * Android POS tablets is, in the vast majority of cases, NOT a bug in the POS
 * page's own code — it is Android's system "recent apps" / task-switcher
 * gesture (an edge-swipe-and-hold from the bottom of the screen). That
 * gesture shrinks WHATEVER app is on screen into a small floating card
 * (showing a blank/white placeholder behind it) and restores it a moment
 * later when released — from the user's point of view it looks exactly like
 * "the screen shrank to a corner and came back", but the web page itself
 * never actually re-rendered or resized anything.
 *
 * No amount of rewriting the POS React code can prevent an OS-level system
 * gesture — that gesture happens above the browser, not inside it. The two
 * real fixes are:
 *   1) Requesting Fullscreen at the browser/OS level, which supresses (or at
 *      least greatly reduces) how easily that edge gesture can be triggered,
 *      and immediately re-asserts fullscreen if it ever gets exited.
 *   2) Enabling Android's built-in "Screen Pinning" (kiosk mode) on the
 *      device itself, which fully disables the home/recent-apps gestures
 *      system-wide. This is a device setting, not something fixable in code
 *      — ask the user to enable "تثبيت الشاشة" (Screen Pinning) in Android
 *      Settings > Security, then triple-tap the app's task-switcher icon (or
 *      hold Overview) and pin Elwa's browser/PWA tab.
